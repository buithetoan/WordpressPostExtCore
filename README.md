# WordpressPostExtCore
# Getting Started
- open webapplication
- change ConnectionStrings in appsettings.json
- rebuild the solution
- copy the extensions DLL files into the Extensions folder of the main web application (this folder doesnâ€™t exist by default, so you need to create it in the web application root or specify another location in the appsettings.json file; also you may just add direct dependencies to the main web application project instead, but it is not so interesting);
- run the main web application.
